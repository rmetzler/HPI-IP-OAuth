\begin{abstract}
Today people are using many different internet services per day. It is hard for users to remember different usernames and passwords for every service they use, so they often reuse the same username and password on different sites. This is a security issue that protocols like OpenID and OAuth try to solve. By creating a single online identity and allowing third party services to authenticate users through them, identity provider are able to solve security issues and enable single sign-on (SSO) above different websites.

By adding an OAuth service provider to the existing HPI Identity Provider we enable third party services to authorize users via OAuth and manage the user's online identities through a newly created RESTful API.
